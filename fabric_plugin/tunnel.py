    Create a tunnel forwarding a locally-visible port to the remote target.

    * ``remote_port`` (mandatory) is the remote port to listen to.
    * ``local_port`` (optional) is the local port to connect to; the default is
      the same port as the remote one.
    * ``local_host`` (optional) is the locally-reachable computer (DNS name or
      IP address) to connect to; the default is ``localhost`` (that is, the
      same computer Fabric is running on).
    * ``remote_bind_address`` (optional) is the remote IP address to bind to
      for listening, on the current target. It should be an IP address assigned
      to an interface on the target (or a DNS name that resolves to such IP).
      You can use "0.0.0.0" to bind to all interfaces.
    .. note::
        By default, most SSH servers only allow remote tunnels to listen to the
        localhost interface (127.0.0.1). In these cases, `remote_bind_address`
        is ignored by the server, and the tunnel will listen only to 127.0.0.1.
